                        <p>A little over 10,000 tonnes a day of plastic waste remains uncollected.
                                Uncollected plastic waste eventually ends up in the natural environment, in our
                                seas and oceans or piling up on our land. People usually throw it here and there
                                thinking it will go into a recycling bin.</p>
